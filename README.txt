This Dataset is based on 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset'.
I sorted this data according to the project criteria.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
- 'project_script.R' : total script for this project.

- 'file_setting.R' : setup for read data from file.

- 'README.txt'

- 'Codebook_total.txt' : every data merges to one data set and shows its information.

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'total_df.Rda' : R dataset of total measurements. Total data is too big, so applied head(2000) and saved.

- 'df_mean.rda' & 'df_sd.Rda' : mean and standard deviation for each measurements.

- 'mean_group.Rda' : data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
